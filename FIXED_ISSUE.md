# 🔧 **ISSUE FIXED - "No feedback submitted yet" Problem Resolved!**

## ✅ **Problem Identified and Fixed**

The issue was that feedback submissions weren't being properly associated with the user ID, so the "My Feedbacks" section couldn't find the user's submitted feedbacks.

## 🛠️ **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Added User ID to Feedback Submission**
- Now each feedback submission includes the `userId` field
- This allows the system to track which user submitted which feedback

### 2. **Created New API Endpoint**
- Added `/api/user/feedbacks` endpoint
- This fetches only the current user's feedbacks (not all college feedbacks)
- Properly filters by user ID

### 3. **Updated JavaScript**
- Changed `loadMyFeedbacks()` to use the new endpoint
- Now fetches user-specific feedbacks instead of all college feedbacks

### 4. **Updated Sample Data**
- Sample feedbacks now have proper `userId` association
- Demo accounts will see existing sample feedbacks

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

1. **User submits feedback** → Feedback saved with `userId`
2. **User returns to home page** → `loadMyFeedbacks()` called
3. **API fetches user's feedbacks** → Only shows their own feedbacks
4. **Displays "Feedback 1", "Feedback 2"** → With passkeys and status

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

### **Step 1: Login as Student**
- Email: `student@college.edu`
- Password: `password`

### **Step 2: Check Home Page**
- You should see 2 sample feedbacks already there
- "Feedback 1: WiFi Issues in Library" (passkey: 1234567890)
- "Feedback 2: Cafeteria Food Quality" (passkey: 0987654321)

### **Step 3: Submit New Feedback**
- Click "Submit Feedback"
- Fill out the form and submit
- You'll be redirected to home page
- You should see "Feedback 3" with your new passkey

### **Step 4: Track Status**
- Click "Track Feedback"
- Enter any of the passkeys (1234567890, 0987654321, or your new one)
- You should see the status

## ✅ **Everything Working Now:**

- ✅ **User-specific feedbacks** - Only shows your own
- ✅ **Proper numbering** - "Feedback 1", "Feedback 2", etc.
- ✅ **Passkey display** - Shows beside each feedback
- ✅ **Status tracking** - Real-time status updates
- ✅ **Admin responses** - Shows admin notes when available
- ✅ **Auto-redirect** - Returns to home after submission
