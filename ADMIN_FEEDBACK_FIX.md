# 🔧 **ADMIN FEEDBACK VISIBILITY FIXED!**

## ✅ **Problem Identified and Resolved:**

The issue was that the admin and users were from different colleges:
- **Admin**: "bmsit" college
- **Sample feedbacks**: "Demo College" 
- **Result**: Admin couldn't see feedbacks from different college

## 🛠️ **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **College Matching**
- Changed all sample data to use "bmsit" college
- Now admin and users are from the same college
- Admin can see all feedbacks from their college

### 2. **Real-time Updates**
- Added Socket.io notifications for new feedback
- Admin gets notified immediately when user submits feedback
- Dashboard refreshes automatically to show new feedback

### 3. **Cross-Device Compatibility**
- Admin on one device can see feedbacks from users on other devices
- Real-time updates work across all devices
- Same college requirement ensures proper data isolation

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Admin Experience:**
1. **Login as admin** → Sees existing sample feedbacks
2. **User submits feedback from other device** → Admin gets real-time notification
3. **Dashboard updates automatically** → New feedback appears immediately
4. **Can manage all feedbacks** → Update status, add notes, reject if needed

### **User Experience:**
1. **Submit feedback from any device** → Gets 10-digit passkey
2. **Admin sees it immediately** → Real-time notification
3. **Track status with passkey** → See admin responses
4. **Cross-device compatibility** → Works from phone, tablet, computer
